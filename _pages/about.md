I am currently studying at SICAU, majoring in GIS (Geographic Information Science). My research interests include spatial analytics, deep learning, and digital media technologies, and I hope to become a master of algorithms one day. I also enjoy making indie games, and have made a silly visual novel with a demo that has been released internally (using the Renpy engine). 

Right now I know a little bit of python, C++, and Rust, though none of them are something I'm proficient in.

What else can I say?

I love ACGN(especially something about magic girls), literature and music.And I often immerse myself in writing fiction and essays.
