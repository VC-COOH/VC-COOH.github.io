I am currently studying at SICAU, majoring in GIS (Geographic Information Science). My research interests include spatial analytics, deep learning, and digital media technologies, and I hope to become a master of algorithms one day. I also enjoy making indie games, and have made a silly visual novel with a demo that has been released internally (using the Renpy engine). 

Right now I know a little bit of python, C++, and Rust, though none of them are something I'm proficient in.

What else can I say?
======
I love ACGN(especially something about magic girls), literature and music.And I often immerse myself in writing fiction and essays.

Post-punk,shoegaze and Midwest emo are my favorite.

In fact,I can play the piano,but it is not something I proficient in,too.

There's nothing to talk about.

(这篇文章充满了愚昧的气息，首先是我的英语水平肯定没有达到学术英语的境地，其次是我根本没有学术和作品，前端是一窍不通的，git更是不会用了……大家看看就行，以后会清零整改的！)


What else do I want to learn?

*Renpy & RPG Maker MV
